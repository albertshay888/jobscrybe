## Jobscrybe

This app will provide users with a job match score based on their resume, indicating keywords on their resume that matches the job description but also keywords that are missing which should be added to their resume thus improving the job match rate score. This allows job seekers to increase their interview chances by having the ability to customize/edit their resume before they apply and save time by working on one platform rather having to copy and paste from another resume builder on to the job board.
