# Jobscrybe

Jobscrybe is a full-stack web application that allows you to search for jobs with the ability to analyze how well your resume matches that job with just one click.

This app will provide users with a job-match score based on their resume, indicating keywords that matches the job description but also keywords that are missing from the job description that should be added to the users resume thus improving their match rate. This allows job seekers to increase their interview chances by having the ability to customize/edit their resume before they apply and save time by working on one platform rather having to copy and paste from another resume builder on to the job board.
